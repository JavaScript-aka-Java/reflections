Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When I want to be able to access it from another computer, or have multiple people work on it, or be able to share it to other people.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Because the files I'm working on could have been changed, creating problems, or maybe I would lose some uncommited changes..
