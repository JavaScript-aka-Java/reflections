How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	Because I could see the lines that were changed, added, or deleted, and only
	those lines, and could quickly locate the error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can see all the changes made in a neat format. I can see the things I've 
    tried, things I've changed, deleted etc.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	Cons of choosing - you may forget, have a crash and loose data; pros - logical
	commit intervals, much more sensible, understandable code versions, commenting
	on specific logicly whole parts, so changes are more and easly understandable.

	Pros of auto - you can't forget, it does it auto. More freguent saves, more 
	history points. Cons - no or less meaningfull commits, no comments or split 
	comments etc.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    So for Git some files can be interconnected and a change in one requires a 
    change in another one; while for docs they are separate entites and a change
    on one of them may not have anything to do with another one.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    with git log we can see all the commits, ie versions of a file of files and 
    their comments. it is used on a specific repository. git diff is used by 
    speciffying two (and perhaps more) commit id's, to see their differences, like
    the lines that where deleted or added.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because if I break something, I can always go back, ae revert to an earlier, 
	working, version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
